# Join
The Joint Roadmap community welcomes participation from organizations and individuals committed to advancing open tools for science and their ecosystem. Formally participating organizations are not-for-profit organizations, institutions, projects, or communities that develop and steward open-source science tools and their ecosystem. Individuals participating formally are typically scholars, technologists, or other practitioners with deep commitments to open science.
