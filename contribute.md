# Contribute
JROST continues to expand pathways to contribute and collaborate. We welcome <a href="mailto:info@jrost.org">your suggestions</a>.

## Mozilla Global Sprint 2018
Our participation in [#mozsprint 2018](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018) was focused on brainstorming for the Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools. We aim to improve the open science landscape systemically by bringing together a range of open projects to explore how they can be improved collectively and integrated towards a more interoperable open science ecosystem.

Join the collaboration that started during the sprint:
* Review and contribute to [existing issues](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues).
* Enter [new issues](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues/new).
* Connect related projects.
